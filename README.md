# Billion Oyster Project 2023 Annual Student Symposium

_Ocean Acidification insights through Geospatial
Visualizations and Time Series Forecasting
for New York Harbor_

Performed an analysis and presented the current case of ocean acidification and its potential impacts on oysters in New York Harbor. The primary mission of this project was to obtain future insights into ocean acidification trends with time series and geospatial analysis, increase awareness of the importance of ocean acidification's health impacts on oysters, and research potential ways to improve the accessibility and agility for citizen scientists to conduct studies with data analysis tooling.
